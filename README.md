### I: CLI-Based Training (50 Episodes, 5k Memory)
Self-learning Flappy Bird AI built with TensorFlow.js and Deep Q-Learning.
The agent trains from scratch in a Node.js environment, improving through trial and error over 50 episodes using a memory buffer of 5,000 game states.

### II: In-Browser Demo
The trained model is loaded directly into the browser, where it plays in real-time on a canvas using only JavaScript and TensorFlow.js â€” no backend required.
Includes real-time visualization of gameplay, score, and optional live training.
